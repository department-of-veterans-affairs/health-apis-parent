  This finding is reported where keystores are loaded to configure SSL endpoints during start up.
  This is safe because resource URL is verified to be either a classpath or local file. Remote URLs
  are not allowed. Furthermore, this resource path is provided as configuration and is not user or
  caller specified.

  <!--
  This finding is reported when data being logged comes from an 'untrusted' source. In this instance,
  the finding is being cause by adding the request made into the log message. The suggested solution is
  sanitizing the message by removing all new line characters (both carriage returns and line feeds). Our
  code does this sanitization of the request value before it enters the log statement.
